A minimal Python package that produces slice plots through h5m DAGMC geometry files

# Installation

```bash
pip install dagmc_geometry_slice_plotter
```

# Python API Usage

These examples assume you have a h5m file called ```dagmc.h5m``` in the same
folder that the Python script is being run from.

The ```plot_axis_slice``` method allows simple axis aligned plots to be made
with minimal user effort.

Create a plot of a slice through the geometry perpendicular to the Z axis and
default settings elsewhere. This will slice through the the center of the
geometry as ```plane_origin``` has not been specified in this example.

```python
from dagmc_geometry_slice_plotter import plot_axis_slice

plot = plot_axis_slice(
    dagmc_file_or_trimesh_object='dagmc.h5m',
    view_direction='z',
)

plot.show()
```

Create a plot of a slice through the geometry perpendicular to the Z axis,
offset by 200cm and with default settings elsewhere.
```python
from dagmc_geometry_slice_plotter import plot_axis_slice

plot = plot_axis_slice(
    dagmc_file_or_trimesh_object='dagmc.h5m',
    plane_origin=[0, 0, 200],
    view_direction='z'
)

plot.show()
```

The ```plot_slice``` function allows more control over the plot as it allows
arbitrary plane normals so that off axis slices can be made and allows the plot
to be rotated.

Create a plot of a slice through the geometry perpendicular to the Y axis, with
a rotation of 45 degrees and with default settings elsewhere. Also saves the
plot with a high resolution (DPI)
```python
from dagmc_geometry_slice_plotter import plot_slice

plot = plot_slice(
    dagmc_file_or_trimesh_object='dagmc.h5m',
    plane_normal=[0, 1, 0],
    rotate_plot=45,
)

plot.savefig('example_3_slice.png', dpi=600)
```

Saves a png image of a plot of a slice through the geometry perpendicular to
the X axis and and with an offset in the x axis.
```python
from dagmc_geometry_slice_plotter import plot_slice

plot = plot_slice(
    dagmc_file_or_trimesh_object='dagmc.h5m',
    plane_normal = [1, 0, 0],
    plane_origin=[10, 0, 0],
    rotate_plot=270,
)

plot.savefig('example_4_slice.png')
```

DAGMC files can also be made using packages like [cad_to_dagmc](https://github.com/fusion-energy/cad_to_dagmc) or [stl_to_h5m](https://github.com/fusion-energy/stl_to_h5m). This example uses CadQuery to make an STL file then converts the STL file to a DAGMC h5m file and plots a slice through the geometry
